A Tera Proxy module that warns you when specific objects(mobs like mongos/blue boxes) are in your VISIBLE vicinity (ie: IN YOUR SIGHT) and puts a marker on them. WILL NOT TELL U ANYTHING IF U CANT SEE IT DON'T ASK HOW TO DO THAT TY. Use common sense and do not use this module/ disable mobmarkers for mob targets with very common spawn rate, instead of complaining of lags >.> This is made for rare spawn events in mind.

This only warns you when the object is loaded onto your visible vicinity (ie. you can see it around you). A mob marker (vergos head) is spawned on mob(bluebox) and despawned when mob is dead/out of range. 

Warning is done via client sided system notices (displays a message in the middle of your screen) as default, but system messages (chat messages) can be turned on. To turn on chat message notification, set 'messager=true' under defaults in index.js or false to disable chat message notifications.

## Config
Configuration can be done via config.json. If not present, it will be generated on first startup.

- `enabled`:Default enabling of the module. True to always enable on startup
- `markenabled`: Enables item markers on monsters. True to spawn item markers.
- `messager`: Enables Messaging via chats. True to enable
- `alerts`: Enable flashing messages for alert. True to enable.
- `Item_ID`: Item ID of item marker
- `Monster_ID`: List of Mobs to look out for. Format: `"<huntingZoneId>_<templateId>" : "<Name of mob>"`

## Commands:
Use the commands in /proxy chat. If you want to use it outside of /proxy chat, make sure you prefix the commands with '!'.

- `warntoggle` - Toggles the module. Disabling the module will clear all markers as well.

- `warnalert` - Toggles system notices

- `warnmarker` - Toggles display of mobmarkers (switch on or off mob markers via toggle)-

- `warnclear` - Attempts to clear all markers and reset the module. Use if vergos head failed to despawn for some weird reason

- `warnadd <huntingZoneId> <templateId> <name of entry>` - Adds and save a custom entry to the config.

Currently supports World Bams and Big Blue Boxes. Can be modified for other objects.
